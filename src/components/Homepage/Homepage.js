          <h3>Software Development Experience</h3>
          <p className="about-me-text">
            I am a versatile software developer with a strong foundation in JavaScript, React.js, Router, HTML, and CSS. My backend expertise lies in building full-stack applications using Express.js, Knex.js, and PostgreSQL, enabling me to create seamless web experiences.
          </p>
          <p className="about-me-text">
          What sets me apart is my deep connection to music and its language, which I seamlessly relate to code. As a professional musician with 13 years of full-time performance experience in New Orleans and on national and international tours, I have honed my intuition and creativity, allowing me to approach software development from a unique perspective.
          </p>
          <p className="about-me-text">
           I am also a passionate educator with over 15 years of teaching experience, spanning middle school to higher education. My work as a professor of the Music Industry at Dillard University demonstrates my dedication to sharing knowledge and inspiring the next generation.
          </p>
          <p className="about-me-text">
            One of my proudest achievements combines my three passionsâ€”software development, music, and educationâ€”through my role as a digital archivist for the Louis Armstrong House Museum in Queens, NY. I had the privilege of helping to develop an accessible online platform for fans and users to explore the rich history of Louis Armstrong.

          <p className="about-me-text">
            On a personal note, I am an avid runner, a witty jokester, and a devoted enthusiast of breweries and BBQ joints. Above all, I am a loving husband and proud father of two beautiful children.
          </p>
          <p className="about-me-text">
            My unique background and love for music, education, and technology enable me to approach software development with empathy, creativity, and a deep understanding of human connection, making me a valuable addition to any team.
